# StudyTimer
The goal of the Android app StudyTimer is to help you focus on your work by using the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break. Repeat 4 times and have a 20 min break). When on break the app will display stretching excercises. After you finish your session you can take a photo of your work that will be displayed the next time to help you get started where you left off.

This is created as my final assignment for the course 'Development of mobile applications' at Ume√• University.
